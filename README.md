🏳️‍🌈 Pride CSS 🏳️‍🌈
=================

Simple useless buttons that animate into different pride flags (made out of gradients) on hover. 

All pride-related styling (the flags and the animations) can be found in the `pride.css` file. All other styling (size of the buttons, fonts, layout, etc) is inside `style.css`. The `index.html` file contains all the examples.
